# Getting Started with DevDuck Agents

Now that you've understood how Docker Model Runner and MCP Gateway works, let's try building DevDuck Multi-Agent application! This section will guide you through the complete setup process, from cloning the repository to accessing your first multi-agent system

DevDuck is a multi-agent system for Node.js programming assistance built with Google Agent Development Kit (ADK). This project features a coordinating agent (DevDuck) that manages two specialized sub-agents (Local Agent and Cerebras) for different programming tasks.

## Architecture

The system consists of three main agents orchestrated by Docker Compose, which plays a **primordial role** in launching and coordinating all agent services:

### 🐙 Docker Compose Orchestration

- **Central Role**: Docker Compose serves as the foundation for the entire multi-agent system
- **Service Orchestration**: Manages the lifecycle of all three agents (DevDuck, Local Agent, and Cerebras)
- **Configuration Management**: Defines agent prompts, model configurations, and service dependencies
  directly in the compose file
- **Network Coordination**: Establishes secure inter-agent communication channels
- **Environment Management**: Handles API keys, model parameters, and runtime configurations

### Agent Components

### 🦆 DevDuck (Main Agent)

- **Role**: Main development assistant and project coordinator
- **Model**: Jan-Nano (`hf.co/menlo/jan-nano-gguf:q4_k_m`)
- **Capabilities**: Routes requests to appropriate sub-agents based on user needs

### 👨‍💻 Local Agent Agent

- **Role**: General development tasks and project coordination
- **Model**:  Lucy (`hf.co/menlo/lucy-gguf:q8_0`)
- **Specialization**: Node.js programming expert for understanding code, explaining concepts, and generating code snippets

### 🧠 Cerebras Agent

- **Role**: Advanced computational tasks and complex problem-solving
- **Model**: Llama-4 Scout (`llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct`)
- **Provider**: Cerebras API
- **Specialization**: Node.js programming expert for complex problem-solving scenarios

## Step 1: Repository Setup

First, let's clone the repository and explore its structure:

### Clone the Repository

```bash
# Clone the Docker Cerebras demo repository
git clone https://github.com/dockersamples/docker-cerebras-demo.git

# Navigate to the project directory
cd docker-cerebras-demo

# List the contents to familiarize yourself
ls -la
```

  - Provide quick responses for development tasks
  - Cache frequently used information
  - Fallback processing when cloud services are unavailable
- **Technology**: Python with local ML models
- **Models**: Lightweight language models (1-7B parameters)

  - Handle file system operations
  - Provide additional context and memory
  - Enable advanced agent interactions
- **Technology**: Docker's MCP Gateway service

### Communication Flow

#### 📡 **Request Processing Flow**

1. **User Input**: User sends request via web interface
2. **Orchestration**: DevDuck analyzes request and determines routing
3. **Agent Selection**: Based on complexity and requirements:
   - Simple queries → Local Agent
   - Complex analysis → Cerebras Agent  
   - Multi-step tasks → Both agents in sequence
4. **Processing**: Selected agent(s) process the request
5. **Response**: DevDuck aggregates and returns unified response



## Environment Configuration

### Required Environment Variables

You'll need to configure these environment variables:

```bash
# Cerebras Configuration
CEREBRAS_API_KEY=your_cerebras_api_key
CEREBRAS_BASE_URL=https://api.cerebras.ai/v1
CEREBRAS_CHAT_MODEL=llama-4-scout-17b-16e-instruct
```


### 🔍 Examine Key Files

Let's look at the main configuration files:

```bash
# View the Docker Compose configuration
cat compose.yml

# Examine the main agent entry point
cat agents/main.py

# Check the agent requirements
cat agents/requirements.txt
```


## Docker Image Preparation

Before deploying, let's understand what Docker will build:

### 🐳 Examine the Dockerfile

```bash
# View the agent Dockerfile
cat agents/Dockerfile
```

**Understanding the Build Process:**
- Base image with Python runtime
- Agent dependencies installation
- Application code copying
- Container startup configuration


## Step 2. System Deployment

Now let's deploy the complete multi-agent system:

### 🚀 Initial Deployment

```bash
# Deploy all services
docker compose up
```

**What to expect during first deployment:**

1. **Image Building** (2-3 minutes)
   - Base image download
   - Python dependencies installation
   - Application code integration

2. **Service Initialization** (1-2 minutes)
   - Container startup
   - Model downloads (if using local models)
   - Service health checks

3. **Network Setup**
   - Internal network creation
   - Port mapping configuration
   - Inter-service communication setup

### 🔄 Development Mode Deployment

For active development with code changes:

```bash
# Run in detached mode (background)
docker compose up -d

# Build and restart when code changes
docker compose up --build
```

## Step 3: Deployment Verification

### ✅ Check Service Status

```bash
# Verify all containers are running
docker compose ps
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NAME                                   IMAGE                               COMMAND                  SERVICE         CREATED         STATUS         PORTS
docker-cerebras-demo-devduck-agent-1   docker-cerebras-demo-devduck-agent  "sh -c 'uvicorn main…"   devduck-agent   2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes   0.0.0.0:8000->8000/tcp
docker-cerebras-demo-mcp-gateway-1     docker/mcp-gateway:latest           "/docker-mcp gateway…"   mcp-gateway     2 minutes ago   Up 2 minutes   
```

### 🩺 Health Check

Perform a comprehensive health check:

```bash
# Check container resource usage
docker stats --no-stream

# Verify agent endpoints
curl -s http://localhost:8000/health | jq .
```


## Step 4: First Access

### 🌐 Access the Web Interface

Open your web browser and navigate to:

**Primary URL**: [http://localhost:8000/dev-ui/?app=devduck](http://localhost:8000/dev-ui/?app=devduck)

**Alternative URLs** (if the primary doesn't work):
- [http://0.0.0.0:8000/dev-ui/?app=devduck](http://0.0.0.0:8000/dev-ui/?app=devduck)
- [http://127.0.0.1:8000/dev-ui/?app=devduck](http://127.0.0.1:8000/dev-ui/?app=devduck)


## Step 5: System Validation

### 🔍 Comprehensive Testing

Run through this validation checklist:

#### Basic Functionality
- [ ] Web interface loads without errors
- [ ] Can send and receive messages
- [ ] DevDuck orchestrator responds appropriately
- [ ] No error messages in container logs



## Success Confirmation

If everything is working correctly, you should see:

✅ **Web Interface**: DevDuck interface loads at http://localhost:8000/dev-ui/?app=devduck  
✅ **Agent Response**: Messages sent receive appropriate responses  
✅ **Container Status**: All containers show "Up" status  
✅ **Resource Usage**: System resources are stable  
✅ **Logs**: No critical errors in application logs
